# Interactive Website for My Boyfriend

This is a fun and interactive website I created for my boyfriend. It includes a multi-page experience, where he will be guided through a few questions. His responses will be sent to me via email for feedback. The website has a black, white, and gray theme with animations for a smooth, engaging experience.

## Features

- **Welcome Page**: Displays a welcoming message and a button to start the journey.
- **Decision Page**: Asks for a decision with options, followed by a text input for a reason.
- **Final Page**: Displays a thank you message after all interactions are complete.
- **Email Feedback**: Collects responses and sends them to my email via EmailJS.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure and content of the website.
- **CSS (Tailwind CSS)**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: For interaction logic, form submission, and animations.
- **GSAP**: JavaScript library for creating animations.
- **EmailJS**: Service used to send emails from the web app.
